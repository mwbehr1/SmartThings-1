# SmartThings
My Samsung SmartThings code and utilities

The [SmartThingsPublic](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/SmartThingsPublic)
repo is a bit large which makes it a bit of a PITA in the SmartThings IDE, so
I've just created this smaller one to house all the code I work on.

Some of the code is taken from others, cached locally so I can easily hack on it
as necessary.
